  --wait-time WAIT_TIME
                        Wait time after all URLs are processed (in seconds) -
                        [Default: 60].

# INSTALLATION AND FIRST USE
This program is preinstalled on BlackArch Linux in the blackarch repo, so if you are using Arch Linux, install the blackarch repo and then run ``` sudo pacman -Syu log4j-bypass ```

Otherwise, install it using the instructions below.

```
# You must have git and python3 installed to use this code
git clone https://github.com/cyberqueen-meg/log4j-bypass.git
cd log4j-bypass
chmod 777 bypass.py
python3 bypass.py -h
```

To use this, you may want to set up a CanaryToken to save the DNS hit results and have them as a cleaner interface. To do so, go to https://canarytokens.org/generate#, select the Log4Shell token, and put the generated token into the program after the ``` --callback-url ``` tag when executing the script. You can also use other services such as http://dnslog.cn or your own hosted server setup through a utility such as marshalsec (https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec), OpenLDAP, or similar resources. If you want to host your own server for this, check out the free TryHackMe room created by John Hammond that walks you through setting up the servers to exploit log4j at https://tryhackme.com/room/solar. You need to set up one of these though.

Email me at cyberqueenmeg@wearehackerone with any questions you have and feel free to fork this repo for your own use or contribute! I'll do my best to keep it updated with new bypasses but I might miss one so please contribute if you find a new bypass :D

Special thanks to https://github.com/fullhunt/log4j-scan for inspiring the majority of this code! This is a fork of their project modified to include more details and make it easier to test all the bypasses and new versions.

Special thanks to https://github.com/Puliczek/CVE-2021-44228-PoC-log4j-bypass-words for providing lots of the bypasses I included in the bypass_payloads array

Special thanks to @noptrix for adding multithreading support and helping me get this software in the BlackArch repo!

This program won an award! Thanks to https://github.com/bugbountyhunters for awarding this program 2nd place in their bug bounty tool competition!

Thank you to all of the defenders who are actively trying to find and patch this vulnerability and who are sharing information and fixes that they have found.
